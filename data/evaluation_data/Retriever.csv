In the first chapter, he dreams of becoming a cartoon artist in order to get rich and escape the cycles of poverty and abuse on the reservation. The idea that hope exists off the rez is echoed in later chapters, where Junior finds himself caught between home on the reservation and pursuing his dreams in the outside world. Junior asks his parents, ``Who has the most hope?'' to which they answer ``White people''. The rez is characterized by lack of opportunity and poor education, the solution to which appears to lie in the Western world.
