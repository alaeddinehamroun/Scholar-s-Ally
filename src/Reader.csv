The modern-day countries with significant territory within the Fertile Crescent are Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Cyprus, Jordan, Israel, Palestine, Egypt, as well as the southeastern fringe of Turkey and the western fringes of Iran. The region saw the development of some of the earliest human civilizations, which flourished thanks to the water supplies and agricultural resources available in the Fertile Crescent. Technological advances made in the region include the development of writing, glass, the wheel, agriculture, and the use of irrigation.']",4.0,"","['9bd470d0d759df70b50224e355f0b2f9-0']","[{'start': 0, 'end': 0}]","[{'start': 697, 'end': 724}]","[{'start': 0, 'end': 0}]","[{'start': 697, 'end': 724}]","[0]","[0]","[0.0]","[0.0]","answer","Reader","integrated",3
